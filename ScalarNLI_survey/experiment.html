          While it is not impossible that Mulroney's approval ratings were very high at the time of the announcement,
          politicians rarely step down when their approval ratings are very high. So the statement is very unlikely to be true.

          It is indeed very unlikely that Mr. Mulroney's approval ratings were very high at the time of his announcement. However,
          the text doesn't say anything about his approval ratings and so it is not impossible that the statement is true.
